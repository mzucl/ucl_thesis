% Test error cases in all classes!

# GammaDistributionContrainer.m 

% TODO (low): Probably inheritance can be useful for these container
% classes as well, e.g. 'GammaDistributionContainer' and 'GaussianDistributionContainer'
% in which case the parameters of the distribution should be a structure

% TODO (low): Maybe some of the error checking can be more flexible, e.g. if the
% lengths don't match we can fill in/cut some of the values.

% TODO (?): Do I need a 2D container of distributions, e.g. if each element in a 
% matrix has a different parameters? Check GFA model. If so, I can still
% implement it as 1D container and just define the access differently.






# GaussianDistribution.m
% TODO: Add a Base class 'Distribution' and inherit from it all
% '...Distribution' classes
% TODO (very low): Maybe add 'private' for properties and implement getters and
% setters (it will complicate stuff a lot)
